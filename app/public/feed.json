    "description": "At the Leafnoise end of year party that took place in Mercedes (Argentina), I was recognized as 'Refactor Man'. I feel very excited and happy for this recognition, since it was a general vote of the whole company. Many times we write code to develop a functionality, in my case I also try to make sure that the code is readable, scalable and above all with good practices. By the way Leafnoise is the company where I am currently working.",
